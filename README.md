This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created to generate and server open graph images for my personal website.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/api/generate](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the generated image.

## Deploy on Vercel

You can clone/fork this repo and modify it to serve images for your own website by deploying to the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) (from the creators of Next.js).
